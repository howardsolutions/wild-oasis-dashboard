<details>

<summary>Open to read (Long List) </summary>

👉 This is the internal app of a Boutique Hotel, used like an internal tools for hotel Employees.
They NEED to logged into the application to Perform any tasks.

👉 New users can only be signed up from the inside the applications - to guarentee that only actual hotel employees can get Accounts.

👉 Needs a Table View with cabins, showing cabin photo, name, capacity, price, current discount...

👉 Users should be able to update or delete the cabin, and create the cabins (uploading cabin photo)

👉 Needs table view for all the bookings, showing Arrival, departure dates, status, and paid amount, as well as cabin and guest data.

👉 Booking status can be `Unconfirmed` (booked, but not checked in), `Checked in`, `Checked out`.
Booking table should be able to filter by these statuses.

👉 Other booking data incluese: number of guests, nights, guest observation, breakfast or not, breakfast price.

👉 Users should be able to delete, checkin, checkout a booking as the guest arrives (no editting necessary for now)

👉 Bookings may not have been paid yet, on guest arival. Thereby, on checkin, users need to accept payment (outside of the app scope), and then CONFIRM manually, payment has been received (inside the application)

👉 On Checkin, guest should have the ability to add breakfast for the entire stay, if they hadn't already.

👉 Guest data : fullname, email, national ID, nationality, country flag

👍 The initial app screen should be a dashboard, to display important information for the Last 7 days, 30, 90 days.

👉 Statistics on recent booking, sales, checkins, occupancy rate

👉 A chart showing all daily Hotel sales, showing both "total" and "extra" sales (extra sales - is only breakfast at the moment!)

👉 A chart showing statistics on stay durations, as this is an important metric for the hotel.

👍 Users should be able to define a few application-wide settings: price for breakfast, min max nights stay, max guest per booking
